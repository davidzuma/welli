## Trade-Offs and Risks

### Identified Risks and Mitigations

#### Risks:
- **Too many notifications**: Users may feel annoyed or overwhelmed if the app sends frequent reminders or suggestions.
- **Not enough content diversity**: A lack of new content or limited options due to the matching content model could reduce user engagement.
- **Unexpected behavior in production**: AI models may behave inconsistently or suboptimally in real-world scenarios despite good evaluation metrics.
- **AI hallucinations**: The micro-coach may generate responses that are nonsensical, unhelpful, or factually incorrect.
- **Privacy concerns**: Specific recommendations might raise concerns about how much personal data the app collects.
- **Mismatch in tone**: AI may fail to match the user's mood, leading to frustrating or inappropriate interactions.
- **Increased costs**: Higher infrastructure demands and external API calls can raise operational expenses.

#### Mitigations:
- **Too many notifications**: Provide user controls for notification frequency and use behavioral triggers to minimize over-messaging.
- **Not enough content diversity**: Introduce randomized or exploratory content to balance personalization with novelty.
- **Unexpected behavior in production**: Begin with simple models, monitor real-world usage, and implement gradual updates.
- **AI hallucinations**: Use structured prompt templates, limit responses to verified content, and add guardrails.
- **Privacy concerns**: Ensure transparency about data usage, offer opt-out options, and avoid excessive targeting in early interactions.
- **Mismatch in tone**: Adjust tone based on user patterns or allow users to select a preferred communication style (e.g., calm vs. upbeat).
- **Increased costs**: Optimize by caching embeddings and responses, using cost-effective models, and limiting dynamic AI features to active users.

Continuous A/B testing and user feedback can help monitor and reduce these risks over time.
