## Trade-Offs and Risks

* **Too many notifications** : If the app sends reminders or suggestions, some users could feel annoyed or overwhelmed. Not everyone wants to be pushed every day. 
* **AI makes strange suggestions sometimes** : Because the micro-coach uses AI to generate daily plans, it can sometimes say things that don’t make much sense or are not really useful. This can feel weird for the user and reduce trust in the app.
* **Privacy concerns**: If recommendations are very specific, users might wonder how much the app knows about them. User's truth is important.
* **Mismatch in tone** : AI doesn’t always get the mood right. For example, if someone is stressed or tired, and the coach sends something too energetic or off-topic, it can feel wrong or frustrating.
