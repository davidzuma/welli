# Discovery sprint

**Discovery sprint to focus on Micro-coach**. 

It’s the most innovative part of the system, and it’s where we can really use the power of LLMs to create a unique and personal experience for the user. Even a simple version could already feel different from most wellness apps, like someone is actually paying attention to you.

I would skip everything else for now and just build a solid, small demo of the micro-coach:

### Scope

* When the user opens the app, they see a short, personal message based on recent activity or motivation.
* Clicking it opens a short interactive chat where the user selects their mood and answers 1–2 questions.
* The micro-coach uses that input to plan a simple daily routine (e.g. one meditation, one stretch).
* The app tracks if the plans has been completed and monitors streaks.

### Why

This experience is fast to prototype, LLM-powered, and could be a competitive edge if it feels personal and useful.

**Note**: This concept could be extended to other wellness routines, such as nutrition or exercise.
