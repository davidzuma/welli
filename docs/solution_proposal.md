## Solution Proposal

### AI/ML-Powered Approach: Modular Personalization System for Early Retention

To improve early user retention, I propose a modular AI/ML system that personalizes the first days of the user journey through a combination of goal-based content matching, behavioral clustering, churn prediction, and a lightweight conversational micro-coach.

Rather than relying on a single model, this approach combines simple but effective components that work together to make the app feel more adaptive, supportive, and relevant from day one. The goal is to create an experience where the user feels understood, supported, and guided — increasing the likelihood of long-term engagement.

### How It Works (Overview of Components)

1. **Goal-to-Content Matching**
   * At onboarding, users set a wellness goal in their own words.
   * An embedding model (e.g., SentenceTransformers) matches that goal to semantically relevant content in the library.
   * This ensures their very first experience feels aligned with their intent.
2. **Early Behavior Clustering**
   * After a few sessions (e.g., 3–5), user behavior is clustered based on engagement style: streaks, content preferences, time of day, etc.
   * Users are grouped into behavioral personas (e.g., “explorers,” “routine-builders,” “casual check-ins”).
   * The app adapts layout, tone, and notifications based on the cluster.
3. **Drop-Off Risk Predictor**
   * A simple binary classifier (e.g., logistic regression or random forest) predicts churn risk after a few days of use.
   * Inputs include streak length, app open frequency, notification response, and content depth.
   * When risk is high, the app triggers a personalized intervention (e.g., a motivational message, reward, or new challenge).
4. **Micro-Coach with Daily Planning**
   * A conversational assistant checks in each day to help users set a small wellness plan (e.g., one meditation + one stretch).
   * It tailors suggestions based on the user’s goal, past activity, and engagement type.
   * The micro-coach also follows up, reinforcing habits and offering encouragement.

### How This Fits Into the User Journey

* **Day 0 (Signup)** : User selects a goal → app immediately recommends semantically matched content.
* **Days 1–5** : Behavioral data is collected → user is clustered → app adapts recommendations and nudging style.
* **Day 3+** : Churn prediction model monitors usage → if risk is high, app intervenes.
* **Daily** : Micro-coach checks in, builds a mini plan with the user, and later follows up to reinforce progress.
