# Problem Exploration

## Core Problem

The main issue is low user engagement and retention after the first couple of weeks. Users can be grouped into three types:

-**Type A:** Download the app and stick with it — they find value and keep coming back.

-**Type B:** Download the app but stop using it after a few weeks — they drop off quickly.

-**Type C:** New users — we don’t know yet whether they’ll stay or churn.

The goal is to help Type C users become more like Type A, and not like Type B. This means:

- Attracting users who are likely to engage long-term.
- Designing an early experience that gets them hooked and delivers real value from day one.

**Note:** While this case focuses on the app experience, marketing efforts are just as important. Targeting the right users from the start can make a big difference in long-term retention.

## Assumptions

- Users download the app because they have a wellness goal (fitness, stress relief, etc.).
- We can collect basic info during onboarding (goals, preferences).
- User behavior can be tracked (content interaction, app open frequency).
- Push notifications can be sent to nudge users.
- There is a social element (users can invite friends or see each other’s progress).

## Signals for Personalization

#TODO: revisit

To identify and engage users early, useful signals include:

-**Streaks:** Are they coming back day after day?

-**App open frequency:** How often do they open the app?

-**Response to notifications**

-**Content interaction:** What types of content do they engage with (meditations, workouts, challenges, etc.)?

-**Goal alignment:** What goal did they choose at onboarding (e.g., “reduce stress,” “get fit,” “sleep better”), and are they actually interacting with content that supports that goal?
